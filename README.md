This is a simple demo that shows how to draw and style the following shapes in Google Maps:
* Circle
* Polyline
* Polygon

There are two modules:  
* app: Kotlin implementation
* java: Java implementation

A thorough explanation can be found in the post [here](http://mobiledevhub.com/2018/12/06/android-how-to-draw-on-google-map/).  
NOTE: In order to use this code, you need to create an API key for Google Maps from https://console.developers.google.com. 
Once you generate the key, you need to add it in **google_maps_api_key.xml** located **res -> values**
